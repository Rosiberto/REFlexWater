The architecture integrates Orion Context Broker, which enables a new generation of applications for intelligent environments; Perseo, which processes the events, applying predefined rules to identify a pattern of interest; Cygnus and STH-Comet, which maintain context information managed by the Orion Context Broker stored in the database over time and recover historical registers from the system and updates trend graphs the monitoring dashboard. 

The solution is based on the NGSIv2. The solution natively supports HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
